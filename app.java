If you use the printf() function without writing #include <stdio.h>, the program will not compile.
The execution of a C program starts from the main() function.
printf() is a library function to send formatted output to the screen. In this program, printf() displays Hello, World! text on the screen.
The return 0; statement is the "Exit status" of the program. In simple terms, the program ends with this statement.
